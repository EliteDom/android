   The following code has no license. While the code is source-readable and encourages community contribution, it is not open source and is not open to replication or redistribution for any use be it personal or commercial.
   
   When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.
